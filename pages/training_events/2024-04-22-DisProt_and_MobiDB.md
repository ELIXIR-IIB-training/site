### Course Description
The BioComputing UP group â€“ University of Padova, in collaboration with ELIXIR-IT, is excited to present a specialized training course on Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP). This course is designed to facilitate the dissemination of two major resources about the disordered protein, [DisProt](https://disprot.org/) and [MobiDB](https://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/), both part of ELIXIR infrastructure, within the scientific community. Through this course, participants will gain fundamental insights into IDP data interpretation, the correlation with specific biological mechanisms and diseases while learning about the essential guidelines for becoming active contributors to the extensive network of DisProt curators.
<br>
<br>

### Target audience
The workshop is open to all biological or biomedical PhD and Post-Doc research scientists, as well as team leaders and PIs.  
<br> 
<br>

### Aims of the workshop 
- Dissemination of IDP resources (DisProt, MobiDB)
- To promote awareness of the importance of IDPs and databases containing IDP data. 
- To highlight the significance of curation in DisProt and to facilitate the discovery and establishment of new collaborations.
<br> 
<br>

### Resources and tools covered
- DisProt [https://disprot.org/](https://disprot.org/)
- MobiDB [https://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/](https://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/)
<br> 
<br>

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, the participants will be able to:
- Access, navigate, and explore the wide range of DisProt and MobiDB data.
- Understand the importance of curation.
- Have the basics of how to curate a disordered protein or a disordered region in DisProt.
<br> 
<br>

### Course prerequisites
You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the resources that will be presented at the course.
Some knowledge of biology and proteins is required for this course. It is recommended to familiarize yourself with intrinsically disordered proteins before attending the course by reviewing the materials shared by the organizers.
