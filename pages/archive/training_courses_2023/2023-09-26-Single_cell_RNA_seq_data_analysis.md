### Course Description
This course aims to provide participants with theoretical and practical knowledge on how to perform bioinformatics analyses of scRNA-seq data using open-source software solutions. scRNA-seq analyses will be performed using the tools available as part of the Reproducible Bioinformatics Project: rCASC [https://github.com/kendomaniac/rCASC](https://github.com/kendomaniac/rCASC). For further details regarding the course content and schedule, please refer to the attached document with course description and program.

<br>

### Target audience
This course is suitable for biologists who are new to single-cell gene expression technology. Prior knowledge of statistics as well as computing skills are not required to attend the course. Each participant is expected to bring their own laptop for the course. However, if needed, the organization can provide laptops for participants. The course requires a very basic level of R, which can be reached following these videos and performing the associated exercises [https://bit.ly/44iW8PQ](https://bit.ly/44iW8PQ).
