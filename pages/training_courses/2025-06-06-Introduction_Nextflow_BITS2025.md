## Course Description 

The course will teach you what Nextflow is, and how to develop your own pipelines with Nextflow. 

The first part of the course covers the core components of the Nextflow language and is specially targeted to newcomers. After this course, you will have learned enough detail to be able to develop simple but fully functional pipelines. It also covers key elements of pipeline design, development and configuration practices.

You will also be introduced to nf-core, a community effort to develop and maintain a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow. It provides a standardised set of best practices, guidelines, and templates for building and sharing scientific pipelines. nf-core is an open-source community which welcomes everyone to join and contribute to.

The second part of the course explores the more advanced features of the Nextflow language and runtime. You will learn how to use them to write efficient and scalable data-intensive workflows.

### Target Audience

The workshop is open to anyone who wants to learn about the Nextflow programming language and wants to be able to build their own Nextflow pipelines.
The second day (Advanced Nextflow) is for those who have attended the first day (Hello Nextflow) or who already have a good knowledge of Nextflow and can already build basic pipelines with it.

<br>
<br>

### Aims of the course

- Learn what Nextflow is
- Be able to code a basic pipeline with Nextflow
- Learn what nf-core is
- Learn the advanced features of Nextflow
- Be able to write efficient and scalable, more complex, workflows

<br>
<br>

### Resources and tools covered

- Nextflow
- nf-core

<br>
<br>

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, the participants will be able to:
- Write their own Nextflow pipelines
- Contribute to nf-core
- Write efficient and scalable pipelines

<br>
<br>

### Prerequisites

For the first day of the course, participants are expected to:
- Have a good knowledge of how to use a terminal. 
- Have a GitHub account and be able to use Codespaces (see [GitHub Codespaces setup docs](https://training.nextflow.io/latest/envsetup/01_setup/)). [PREFERRED OPTION]
- Alternatively you can follow the instructions for [local installation](https://training.nextflow.io/latest/envsetup/02_local/) and use the [Devcontiners extension](https://training.nextflow.io/latest/envsetup/03_devcontainer/) if you prefer using VSCode.

For the second day of the course, participants are expected to:
- All of the above
- Have a good knowledge of Nextflow, or have attended the first day of the course.
