<br>

### Resources and tools covered 
- R project: [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/)
- Rstudio

<br>

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, the participants will:
- Know what the R programming language is: areas of use and strengths
- Be able to code and be able to perform basic operations with R (e.g., importing data files into a data.frame; creating and extracting values from vectors, matrices, data.frames or lists; plotting)
- Know how to inspect and graphically represent in R basic statistical indicators (mean, median, distribution) of a numerical data set
- Possess a basic knowledge of R that makes it possible to go deeper if necessary

<br>

### Course prerequisites
No prior understanding of programming and knowledge of R are required. It is mandatory to install R and Rstudio on the participants’ PC before starting the course.
