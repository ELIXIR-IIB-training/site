### Target Audience

The Metabolomics Academy is designed for: Undergraduate and PhD students new to metabolomics and researchers and R&D professionals looking to deepen their knowledge through discussion with experts in the field.

<br>
<br>

### Objectives

Gain familiarity with key metabolomics applications in fields such as environmental science, nutraceuticals, food science, and personalized medicine.
Learn the most appropriate techniques for sample preparation and data acquisition using mass spectrometry. 
Understand untargeted, targeted, and labeling approaches. Develop statistical analysis skills. 
Use metabolomics data to explore biochemistry and metabolism. 
Receive guidance on designing personalized metabolomics experiments (covering areas such as primary and secondary metabolism, lipidomics, food composition, natural products, exposome, and volatilome) based on a case study of interest.

<br>
<br>

### Prerequisites

Participants should have basic knowledge of biology and/or biochemistry.
