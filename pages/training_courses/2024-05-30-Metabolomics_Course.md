### Course Description
Metabolomics is the large-scale study of small molecules known as metabolites which constitute the metabolom, the downstream effect of an organism’s genome and its interaction with the environment. This young field of the Life Sciences arena has widespread applications across the medical, clinical, biological, environmental and agricultural sciences fitting precisely into the #OneHealth approach.   
We will show how exciting and multi-colored Metabolomics can be including the challenges and its current limits.  Special attention will be given to the following topics   
1. Practice and theory in metabolomic applications;  
2. Study design and sample collection;  
3. Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics;  
4. Metabolic Flux Analysis;  
5. Latest research in One Health metabolomics. 

<br>
<br>

### Target audience

This workshop is designed for scientists approaching metabolomics and those who want to improve their knowledge and competencies through open discussions with experts in this field.
<br>
<br>

### Aims of the workshop 

This workshop focuses on experimental design and sample preparation matrix enabling junior and senior scientists to apply metabolomics approaches to a research-based context.    
Attendees will be guided through mass spectrometry-based experiment designs, learning about cutting-edge equipment and different technical procedures for metabolomics. 

<br>
<br>

### Learning Outcomes 

By the end of this workshop the participants will be able to: 
1. Describe what Metabolomics is and what it is used for. 
2. Design a metabolomics experiment in all its steps. 
3. Know different kinds of sample preparation. 
4. Discern the importance of Metabolomics in a specific research context.

<br>
<br>

### Course prerequisites
Participants are expected to have basic knowledge of biology and/or biochemistry
