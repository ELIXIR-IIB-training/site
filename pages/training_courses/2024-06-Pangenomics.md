## Course Description
Participants will learn about pangenome concepts and gain practical experience building and analyzing pangenome graphs. They will apply these methods to complex research questions that require understanding the relationships between multiple genomes or accounting for variability when analyzing new genomes. By the end of the practical course / workshop, participants will have a strong understanding of pangenome methods based on whole genome assemblies.

## Important Dates 

Deadline for applications: **17 May 2024**
Chosen participants will be notified by: **24 May 2024**
Course date: **19-21 June 2024**
<br>
<br>

### Venue

Aula informatizzata, 2nd Floor, Building CU010, Sapienza University of Rome, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, 00185 Rome, Italy **[link to the map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/REeKpiBCU8PzoorZ8)**
<br>
<br>

### Fee

The course include a fee 70â‚¬ and it include all coffee breaks, lunck . Participants are expected to pay their own **travel** and **accomodation** costs (if any).
<br>
<br>

### Selection
A maximum of **24** candidates will be selected based on their need for the course as emerging from the application form. Chosen participants will be notified by 17th May 2024. Priority will be given to candidates from ELIXIR-IIB member institutes (see the list at the bottom) and ELIXIR Nodes.
Go to the Application Form - Registration.

**Cancellation policy**: Attendance is limited to 24 participants. We expect many more applications. Accepted participants commit to attend the course for its whole duration. Failure to attend training sessions is disruptive. Moreover, it blocks other candidates from participating. Therefore, a cancellation policy is in place so that only written requests presented 10 days in advance relatively to the course starting date are accepted.

<br>

### Target audience
This course is aimed at PhD-students, post docs or other researchers interested in learning about pangenomics. It will be especially useful for researchers that have (or will have) data of their own.
<br>
<br>

### Learning outcomes
By the end of this course, learners will be independently able to:

Understand the concepts and importance of pangenomics in addressing reference bias and capturing genome variability.
Apply pangenome methods to complex research questions that require understanding the relationships between multiple genomes or accounting for variability when analyzing new genomes.
Gain practical experience in building pangenome graphs from whole-genome assemblies using tools like PGGB and ODGI.
Learn how to analyze and interpret pangenome graphs
<br>
<br>

### Course prerequisites
The participants will need to have some experience in Linux command line (bash), enough to start tools and find paths to files. Experience with Next Generation Sequencing data and common file formats (fasta, fastq, bam, etc.) will be extremely useful, but is not mandatory.
