### Target audience

The target audience is (computational) biologists or bioinformaticians who are familiar with basic computational analysis but want to improve their skills in managing software environments, using containers, and working with notebooks.
The course is ideal for those looking to streamline their workflows, ensure reproducibility, and effectively collaborate on computational projects.

<br>
<br>

### Aims of the workshop 
- To provide participants with a foundational understanding of software environments, containerisation, and notebooks for managing computational workflows;
- To introduce tools that support reproducibility, portability, and efficiency in bioinformatics research;
- To offer practical skills in deploying and managing environments, using containers, and working with Jupyter notebooks.

<br>
<br>

### Resources and tools covered

- Conda environments and their installation
- Conda channels (bioconda, conda-forge)
- Containers (Docker)
- Integration of containers and conda environments
- Markdown scripting, JupyterHub and Jupyter notebooks

<br>
<br>

### Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, participants will be able to:
- Set up and manage isolated software environments using Conda;
- Build, deploy, and use containers;
- Create and share reproducible analyses using Jupyter Notebooks;
- Understand the importance of these tools for collaborative and reproducible research.

<br>
<br>

### Course prerequisites

Basic Knowledge of Unix. Linux/Windows/OSX are fine. An assessment questionnaire will be sent for the selection of participants
