## Course Description

The study of the networks of protein-protein interactions within a cell, called "interactome", provides information about the organization of the cell and allows us to identify proteins and signaling pathways that are disrupted or deregulated during a disease condition.  
In this course, through a practical example, we will use the open-source software Cytoscape and some of its apps to extract protein-protein interaction data, build the network, visualize and explore it in order to detect topological properties, find potential topological clusters and perform functional network enrichment analysis.

### Target audience

The course is for people participating to the workshop: [“Young Minds at Work: Blending Biochemistry and Bioinformatics - 2nd edition”](https://www.blendingbb.it/ymw2024/)

<br>
<br>

### Aims of the workshop 

- To provide practical demonstrations of several freely available protein-protein interactions resources.
- To improve competences in protein-protein network analysis.
- To improve the knowledge of Cytoscape and its network analysis and gene enrichment analysis tools.

<br>
<br>

### Resources and tools covered

- IMEx resources
- STRING
- Cytoscape
- IntactApp
- MCODE
- ClueGo

<br>
<br>

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, the participants will be able to:

• Identify and access public data resources and tools to study protein-protein interactions 
• Interpret the information given in different molecular interaction databases
• Represent networks using Cytoscape
• Perform network and functional analysis

<br>
<br>

### Course prerequisites

Participants don’t need to have bioinformatics skills and previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the course. Attendees may bring in their own datasets for analysis, although example datasets will be available.
