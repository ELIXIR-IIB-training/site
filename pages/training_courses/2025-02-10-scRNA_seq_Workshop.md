## Course Description

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis using open-source tools, with a focus on the rCASC package [https://github.com/kendomaniac/rCASC](https://github.com/kendomaniac/rCASC). Participants will delve into experimental design principles, quality control for single-cell sequence outputs, and data reduction and clustering techniques to identify cell subpopulations. The course also offers an overview of the computational theory behind scRNA-seq tools, empowering participants to make informed decisions during analysis. Practical, hands-on sessions will allow attendees to work with real datasets and integrate results to extract meaningful biological insights.

### Target audience

A maximum of 20 candidates will be selected. The workshop is suitable for life scientists who are new to single cell gene expression technology data analysis. It is open to PhD and Post-Doc research scientists, as well as team leaders and PIs. No prior knowledge of statistics or computing skills is required. However, a basic understanding of R programming is preferred. Prior knowledge of single-cell sequencing technologies is required. 

<br>
<br>

### Aims of the workshop 

- Introduce the principles and importance of designing effective scRNA-seq experiments.   
- Guide participants through quality control, data reduction, and clustering methods for scRNA-seq data.   
- Provide hands-on experience to develop practical analysis skills and enable the extraction and interpretation of biological insights from scRNA-seq datasets.

<br>
<br>

### Resources and tools covered

rCASC package for scRNA-seq analysis ([https://github.com/kendomaniac/rCASC](https://github.com/kendomaniac/rCASC))

<br>
<br>

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

* Describe the importance of experimental design to ask sensible biological questions at single cell level.  
* Assess the quality of your data.  
* Describe limits and strength of clustering in scRNA-seq.  
* Identify genes driving cluster formation in scRNA-seq.  
* Annotate cell types  
* Performe batch correction and experiment integration on scRNA-seq data.

<br>
<br>

### Course prerequisites

Before starting the course, participants are requested to follow a brief and simple course on R, approximately 4 hours. The video lessons and lesson pdfs with exercises are available at [https://bit.ly/47XmDwx](https://bit.ly/47XmDwx)
